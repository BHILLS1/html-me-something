                 <h2>About Me</h2>     
                <p>Yoga is one of the modalities that I use to show up and shine brightly in this world. I am 
                a trauma-informed trained yoga instructor (RYT 200), Reiki Practitioner, dancer and music enthusiast.
                I have a passion for cultivating wellness and building connection in communities of color.
                I create sonically driven practices, centering her classes around musical energy.
                By curating and leading practices driven by music of the culture of the community that I'm 
                a part of, I creates an environment that welcomes people of color to appreciate a yoga practice 
                created authentically for them. I am the creator of Back Trap Yoga, St. Louis&apos; first Trap yoga experience 
                &mdash; a high energy, beat banging, unsuspecting approach to bring breath, movement and sonic connection together 
                in an unforgettable way.</p>

                  <h2><strong>Back Trap Yoga</strong></h2> 
                <p>The practice of unifying mind and body through yoga, partnered with conscious rhymes
                    and the beat banging sounds of trap music is the essence of Back Trap Yoga; an hour long,
                    all levels, sonically driven yoga flow. Connection is the motive. Connecting to your breath,
                    your highest self, and others makes for a transformative experience where you might least expect
                    it. Hydrate, lay ya edges and get ready to WERK. [Back Trap Yoga is St. Louis' first Trap Yoga experience]
